    <!--
        Here are many changeSets which add multiple records to same table.
        For this kind of changeSets only the first records is checked to see
        if the changeSets should be run or not - it is assumed that any system
        which runs before a changeSets ware added already has either all data
        from the changeSets or none.
        E.g.: if system has 'Dosing' visit type, it is assumed that it also
        has 'Other' so the changeSets cfl-vmp-initial-setup-2 will not run.
